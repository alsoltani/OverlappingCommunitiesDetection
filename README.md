# Overlapping Communities Detection

## Statistical Analysis of Network Data, ENSAE 2015.

To this project aims at studying algorithms for overlapping community detection, e.g. in social networks.
Developments will be based on the following papers :

_"Overlapping Communities Detection via Measure Space Embedding"_, Mark Kozdoba, Shie Mannor
`http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06796v2.pdf`

_"Leveraging disjoint communities for detecting overlapping community structure"_, Tanmoy Chakraborty
